### The Mat Structure

_Mat_ is how OpenCV handles the images. It is the underlying data structures that allows OpenCV to process and manipulate the images or image sequences.

The upside of using OpenCV is that it provides you memory management out of the box, the programmer doesn't have tow orry about it. And it all happens because of the way this unique data structure is designed.

The _Mat_ structure contains two parts. The first is its _header_. Think of it as a meta store. This meta store contains information such as the size of the matrix, method used for storing, the address in memory at which the matrix is stored. The second part contains a pointer to the matrix containing the pixel values.

How is that beneficial? Say, when you copy an image to another variable, 

    A = imread(argv[1], IMREAD_COLOR); 
    B = A; // only headers are copied.

This comes from the [official OpenCV documentation]()

        int dims;
        //! the number of rows and columns or (-1, -1) when the array has more than 2 dimensions
        int rows, cols;
        //! pointer to the data
        uchar* data;

        //! pointer to the reference counter;
        // when array points to user-allocated data, the pointer is NULL
        int* refcount;

        // other members
        ...
